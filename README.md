# Optimal-adaptive-control-with-separable-drift-uncertainty
The Code used to generate the numerical insights in the paper "Optimal adaptive control with separable drift uncertainty"

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Deep GAlerkin Method, including it's proposed architecture to solve the fully nonlinear HJB equation of the stocahstic control problem investigated in "Optimal adaptive control with separable drift uncertainty" numerically.
